Here’s a link to our paper on physical modeling wave attenuation through mangroves

https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.780946/full

 

And here’s a link to the published data set on DesignSafe

The “reports” folder has a ReadMe, Kiernan’s MS thesis, and a spreadsheet listing all of the trials and characteristics of depth, H, T, and flume configurations.

 

On my to do list

    check with Kayla and Maggie on what cases we’ve run so far w/ XBeach surfbeat, and plans for nonhydrostatic mode
    check with Sungwon Shin (Hanyang Univ Korea, former OSU PhD) on his plans for running OpenFoam
    check with Kiernan on whether he looked at mean water level

 

I mentioned that we also looked at the mangrove+wall case.  Pedro presented some of this at the last ICCE in Sydney, but we haven’t submitted the journal paper yet.  

 

Maybe we can have a group discussion in September to see what cases people are interested in modeling.
